ActiveStorage is an optional part of ActiveRecord that helps you store files.  Go ahead and add ActiveStorage through the terminal with the following command: rails active_storage:install.  Although this isn't a model, you'll still have to migrate it using rails db:migrate. For learning purposes, go ahead and take a look at the migration file before you do, but don't make any changes."}}

As you know ActiveRecord is how Rails talks to your database. ActiveStorage is an optional part of ActiveRecord that helps you store files.  Go ahead and add ActiveStorage through the terminal with the following command: rails active_storage:install.  Although this isn't a model, you'll still have to migrate it using rails db:migrate. For learning purposes, go ahead and take a look at the migration file before you do, but don't make any changes."], ["user_id", 9], ["created_at", "2020-07-17 21:22:24.313162"], ["updated_at", "2020-07-17 21:22:24.313162"]]
